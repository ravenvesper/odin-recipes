        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>slash the fat rimming one side of the loin cutlet to keep the meat from curling 
                when deepfried. pound to flatten to about 1/4 inch. salt and pepper both sides of 
                each cutlet. dredge each in flour, then dip into beaten eggs and press into bread 
                crumbs to coat both sides.</li>
            <li>heat a large skillet with about 1/2 inch of oil until hot. lay 1 or 2 cutlets in 
                the hot oil. deep-fry until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes, turning them once 
                or twice. drain the cutlets on paper towels and cut the pork into bite-size strips 
                that can be eaten with chopsticks. </li>
            <li>arrange the pork on a platter lined with the shredded cabbage, and garnish with 
                lemon wedges. serve the sauce on the side for dipping, or pour it over the pork 
                and cabbage.</li>
        </ol>
