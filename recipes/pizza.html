        <h2>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, 
            flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, 
            and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, 
            traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.</h2>

        <h3>stepsss</h3>
        <p><strong>making the pizza dough</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>proof the yeast:</strong>
                <br>
                place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. sprinkle the yeast over
                the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved. after 5 minutes, stir if the yeast 
                hasn't dissolved completely. the yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the 
                yeast is still active and alive. (note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no 
                proofing is required. just add flour in the next step.)
            </li>
            <li><strong>make and knead the pizza dough:</strong>
                <br>
                add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for 
                a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment. knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed 
                using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes. if you don't have any mixer, you can mix the ingredients together 
                and knead them by hand. the dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. if it's too wet, sprinkle a 
                little more flour.
            </li>
            <li><strong>let the dough rise:</strong>
                <br>
                spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around 
                so that it gets coated with the oil. at this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. a slow 
                fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. a quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours 
                in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with. cover the dough with plastic wrap. for a quick rise, 
                place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours. for a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature 
                place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no 
                more than 48 hours). the longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.

            <p><strong>preparing the pizzas</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><Strong>preheat the pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet):</Strong>
                <br>
                place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. 
                if you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures.
